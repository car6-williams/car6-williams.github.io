title: About Me

My name is Christopher Rodriguez and this is my website for Electronic Textiles. I would like to take Electronic Textiles to learn coding skills that will transfer to my artistic practice. In Electronix Texitles we will learn basic electrical circits included how to make light flash. I hope to bring these skills into larger installations I do in the future. I have no previous experience in computer science, so this course would be very helpful in teaching me not only begginer level basics, but also the basics I need for an artisitc practice.
