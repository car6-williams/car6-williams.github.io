My name is Christopher Rodriguez and I am a senior studying studio art at Williams College. Despite studying studio art, I have no experience with sewing or textiles. Likewise, I have no experience coding except from casual play with Strudel (a music coding website). 

My artistic practice mainly focuses on installation and sculpture. As a part of these installations I often include sound and light. In this class I hope to learn transferable skills that I can continue to use in artistic projects. Firstly, knowledge of how to sew would greatly help me. Secondly, learning how to code lights would allow me to elevate my installations. My goal is to make lights flicker, dim, and strobe without me having to physically control equipment in the moment. If possible, I would also like to sync light movement to audio stimuli so it can mimic the bass componant of certain audio.
